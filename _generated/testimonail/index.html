                          >“When my mom needed memory care, we looked at many
                          facilities in the local area. Several of them were
                          places I would never want my mom to experience. Some
                          of the larger ones were so impersonal that my mom
                          would have been miserable. We were looking for a place
                          where she would be treated with respect and dignity,
                          despite her dementia and some personality issues. As
                          soon as we walked in to Windsor Gardens, we knew this
                          was the place for mom. Throughout her 2 1/2 year stay
                          there, she received the best of care, good food, and
                          was treated extremely well. I would have no hesitation
                          recommending Windsor Gardens to anyone in need of
                          memory care services for a loved one. And if and when
                          that time comes for me, I would choose Windsor Gardens
                          for my own care.”&nbsp;</em

                          TIME. My mother has dementia and her personality
                          fluctuates from sunny to crabby. They are wonderfully
                          patient in often difficult situations. After having
                          Mom in another facility we moved her to Windsor
                          Gardens and immediately I had a "partner" with her
                          care. They are always available to give me a report on
                          what is going on and ANY of the staff can answer any
                          question. So I know they are all involved in her care.
                          Windsor Gardens is the best and I am so thankful for
                          them.” -Carol W.</em
